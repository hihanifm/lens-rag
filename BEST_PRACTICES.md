# LENS — Best Practices

Shared reference for the developer and Claude. Covers React, FastAPI, Git, and general rules.
All practices are grounded in the actual patterns already in this codebase — nothing speculative.

---

## 1. React / Frontend

### Component structure
- Functional components only — no class components
- One component per file; filename matches component name (PascalCase)
- Pages go in `src/pages/`, reusable pieces in `src/components/`
- Default-export the component; named-export only for utilities

### State management
- `useState` for local UI state (form inputs, toggles, loading/error flags)
- TanStack Query (`useQuery`, `useMutation`) for all server state — no manual fetch-in-useEffect
- No Redux, no Context API — they're not needed at this scale
- Don't use `useEffect` to derive state; use `useMemo` or compute inline instead

### API calls
- All `axios` calls live in `src/api/client.js` — never inline `fetch` or `axios` in a component
- Functions are plain async functions returning `r.data`; components just `await` them
- SSE (ingestion progress) uses `EventSource`; close it in the `useEffect` cleanup function

### Error handling
- Always show a user-facing message (e.g. "Search failed. Please try again.")
- Log the raw error to the console for debugging — don't swallow it silently
- Use `[error, setError] = useState(null)` and render the message in JSX

### Styling (Tailwind)
- Utility classes inline only — no separate CSS files except `index.css` for globals
- Conditional classes via template literals: `` `px-4 ${isActive ? 'bg-blue-600' : 'bg-gray-100'}` ``
- No custom CSS unless there is genuinely no Tailwind equivalent

### General
- No TypeScript (project decision) — compensate with descriptive prop and variable names
- Use `useMemo` for expensive column definitions (TanStack Table pattern already in place)
- Never hardcode API base URLs in components — they're in `client.js` via Vite proxy

## 2. FastAPI / Backend

### Python environment — always use a venv
```bash
# First time
python -m venv .venv

# Every session before running pip or python
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install deps
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```
**Never install packages globally.** Claude must activate `.venv` before running any `pip` or `python` command.

### Route handlers
- Validate early — raise `HTTPException` before doing any DB or compute work
- Always include a meaningful `detail` string: `"Project not ready (status: ingesting)"`
- Use explicit HTTP status codes: 404 for missing resource, 400 for bad state, 422 for bad input
- Never put DB logic directly in route handlers — delegate to `projects.py`, `search.py`, etc.

### Database
- All queries use parameterized placeholders: `cur.execute("SELECT ... WHERE id = %s", [id])`
- Never use f-strings or `.format()` to build SQL values — SQL injection risk
- Always use the `get_cursor()` context manager — never open a connection manually
- Schema names are safe (generated from integer project IDs, no user input touches them)

### Configuration
- Read all config from `config.py` — never call `os.environ.get()` in logic files
- If a new config value is needed, add it to `config.py` first, then import it

### Pydantic models
- Define a `BaseModel` for every request body and response body
- Use `Optional[Type] = None` for optional fields; use typed lists `List[str]`, not bare `list`
- Keep models in `models.py`; don't define inline in route files

### Streaming (SSE)
- Long operations (ingestion) yield dicts from a generator, wrapped in `StreamingResponse`
- Yield `{"step": "progress", "percent": N}` during work, `{"step": "complete"}` at the end
- Frontend uses `EventSource` to consume the stream

## 3. Git & Workflow

### Commit messages
- Imperative present tense, under 72 characters
- Good: `Add SSE progress bar to ingestion`, `Fix SSE base URL mismatch in CreateProject`
- Bad: `fixed the bug`, `changes`, `WIP`

### Commits
- One logical change per commit — don't bundle unrelated fixes or refactors
- Never commit `.env`, secrets, or API keys — they go in a local `.env` file only
- Check `git status` before committing to avoid accidental file inclusion

### Branches
- `feature/short-description` for new functionality
- `fix/short-description` for bug fixes
- Keep branches short-lived; merge or rebase frequently against `main`

### Before pushing
- Run `make build` to confirm the Docker image still compiles cleanly
- Verify the frontend builds without errors: `cd frontend && npm run build`

## 4. General Rules (Claude + Developer)

- **KISS** — if a simpler approach exists, take it; add complexity only when the simpler path provably fails
- **No external API calls** — zero data leaves the network; no OpenAI, no cloud services
- **No LLM in the query path** — search returns results, nothing more
- **Config in one place** — `config.py` for backend, `client.js` for frontend API base
- **No speculative abstractions** — solve the real problem in front of you; three similar lines beat a premature helper
- **No comments explaining *what* code does** — only add a comment when the *why* is non-obvious (a workaround, a hidden constraint, a subtle invariant)
- **No cleanup beyond the task** — a bug fix doesn't need surrounding refactoring; keep diffs small and reviewable
